# Bakery-Landing-Page
My landing page for a fake bakery.

## Description
The Simple Bake Shop is a warm, cozy bakery-themed website designed to showcase a menu of breads, pastries, and sweets in a simple and inviting way. It highlights different baked goods, provides helpful information like hours and location, and gives visitors an easy way to explore what the shop offers.

I created this website as a personal learning project; a way to improve my web development skills, experiment with design, and learn how to debug real problems through trial and error. Every page represents something I’ve learned while building, fixing, and refining the site.
